# Unicorn Companies Fact Sheet - Data Analysis with SQL and Tableau

Unicorn (companies) is a term commonly used in venture capital to describe privately held startups whose valuation exceeds one billion.

## Data cleaning and preparation with MySQL

Here’s the [MySQL code](https://github.com/yao-sisi/unicorn/blob/main/.gitignore)

## Data Visualization in Tableau

Some of the questions that inspired the visualization were:

- Which industries are getting the biggest piece of the pie (in terms of capital)?
- Are there any trends over time?
- Which countries are the leaders in “unicorn production”?
- Who are the biggest investors?

Here’s the [Tableau viz](https://public.tableau.com/views/UnicornCompaniesFactSheet/UnicornCompaniesFactSheet?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Limitations of the analysis

I realized and recognized that the data I was given does not tell the full story of the ROI of a certain Super Bowl commercial — I only had information such as TV and YouTube views. Additional questions I wanted to ask include — were these ads also trending and being talked about on social media and if that had an impact on the increase in sales for example, in which other ways do advertisers benefit from placing an ad at a high profile event like the Super Bowl, how can viewership from Youtube be improved?
